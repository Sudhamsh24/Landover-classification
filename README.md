Land Cover Change Detection using Multispectral Images

This project focuses on remote sensing and land cover analysis using multispectral satellite images. It applies vegetation, water, and built-up indices to classify land cover and performs urban change detection between two different time periods.

Features
Upload and preprocess multispectral images (.TIF / .TIFF)

Compute key spectral indices:
NDVI – Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (Vegetation/Forest)
NDWI – Normalized Difference Water Index (Water Bodies)
NDBI – Normalized Difference Built-up Index (Urban/Built-up Areas)
